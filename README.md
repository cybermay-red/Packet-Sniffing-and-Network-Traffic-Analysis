Packet Sniffing and Network Traffic Analysis  
By Maryam Sulaiman

Description:  
This project demonstrates how to capture and analyze network traffic using tools like tcpdump, Wireshark, Netcat, and Nmap. It focuses on identifying unencrypted data and potential security risks in common network protocols such as HTTP, FTP, and TCP.

Objectives:  
- Capture real network traffic between two virtual machines  
- Analyze HTTP, FTP, Netcat sessions, and Nmap scan patterns  
- Understand how packet sniffing can expose sensitive data  
- Show the importance of using encrypted communication

Tools Used:  
- Kali Linux  
- Metasploitable 2  
- Wireshark  
- Tcpdump  
- Netcat  
- Nmap  
- VirtualBox

Project Files:  
- report.docx: Full report with step-by-step analysis and screenshots  
- screenshots: Folder containing captured screenshot images  

How to Use:  
Open the report.docx file to read the full analysis and findings. Screenshots are included for each protocol to illustrate captured traffic.

Note:  
This project was done in a controlled lab environment. All tests were performed ethically for learning purposes only.
